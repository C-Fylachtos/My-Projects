        <h1>CSS3 Logos</h1>
        <h3>Landing page demo</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a CSS nerd and, like most people, I was excited that CSS3 brought
          new possibilities for drawing shapes like buttons, tooltips, ribbons,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was tinkering one day with CSS, trying to create some
          GoogleMaps-like pins from only 1 HTML element, but my mind was on that
          Adidas Originals t-shirt I saw on TV, and the idea popped into my
          head. The first render of the logo sucked, but by the time I got to
          the Nike logo, I realized that CSS has some hidden (from me) power.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like puzzles, so working in vector software to emulate the powers of
          CSS3, was a pretty fun project. I'm glad so many people enjoyed it.

          The date is October 1st, 2015. For the last 3 hours, I've been
          researching as much as I can about Mars occasionally stopping to drool
          over those beautiful red-tinted landscapes. I'm working on an email
          campaign titled Add Mars to your travel bucket-list - funny for a
          designer at <a href="booking.com">Booking.com</a>,{" "}
          <em>"Planet Earth's #1 Accommodation Site"</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let me tell you how I got myself into this project. This
          morning I was riding the metro to work. I'm in my own world, head
          tilted downwards and browsing on Flipboard to get my daily dose of
          news. That's when it found me:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-confirms-evidence-that-liquid-water-flows-on-today-s-mars/">
            NASA Confirms Evidence That Liquid Water Flows on Today's Mars
          </a>
          . Water! On Mars?! Mind <em>blown</em>. I devoured the entire article,
          washing it down with anything else I could find about Mars - hydrated
          salts, perchlorate, and various other terms that sounded cool (but
          were too scientific for me to grasp). I suddenly had this longing
          desire to visit that place, to explore, to get my boots covered in red
          dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Booking.com, ideas flow freely and come, mostly, from the ground
          up. Everyone is encouraged to contribute ideas and to follow through
          with them. Even so, when I stole a few minutes from the Product Owner
          of Email Marketing to pitch a travel campaign for Mars, her reaction
          was better than I could have anticipated. Not only did she agree to
          change our Sunday campaign, but she rearranged her whole day so that
          we could start searching for otherworldly holiday destinations right
          here on Earth. Here are some of the gems that we found:

          These places are scattered all over the globe, some only 3 hours away
          from our office here in Amsterdam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the list was complete, we took the idea to our copywriters and
          they eagerly jumped on board. After that, all we needed was a back-end
          developer and 14 hours later we'd created an email and{" "}
          <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2299776-Get-ready-for-the-Final-Frontier">

          from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
          My hand was shaking as I hovered with the cursor over the{" "}
          <em>"send"</em> button. What we'd created was to be shared with
          millions of people out there. Happily, the response carried some
          really positive energy - overwhelming and humbling at the same time.

          Today I look to the seven-year-old me, the one who had a dream to
          achieve something great (only knowing it would have to involve a
          keyboard somehow). I know he would be smiling - against all odds, his
          dream came true. I'm grateful for this day; even more so because it's
          not the first time I've felt like this while working at Booking.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this was possible thanks to an open environment and stellar
          talent. Even with such a fast-growing department, individuals are
          still trusted to make the best decisions for the company. We're
          constantly encouraged to think outside the box, to take chances, and
          discover new possibilities to grow our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without personal contributions, we wouldn't be standing here today. So
          I want to challenge you to step back for 15 minutes and let your
          imagination fly. If sending people to Mars wasn't too crazy an idea
          for a company specializing in accommodations on Earth, then what can
          you come up with to positively impact your company?
